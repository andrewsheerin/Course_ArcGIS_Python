# Assignments

This is a three-credit computer lab course and assignments to work towards these credits will be assessed accordingly.

For each assignment, please see our Classroom [site](https://github.com/Course-ArcGIS-Python-Master), which will allow you to upload your repositories as submissions and download starter code. All assignments must be submitted through our Github Classroom site. You will receive an invitation to this before the first piece of work is set.

### Weighting

Assignment | Weighting | Set | Due
---------- | --------- | --- | ---
Attendance | 10% | | End of term
Quizzes pre-class online coding challenges | 20% | Each week | Each week
Midterm tool challenge | 25% | Session before Spring Break | Session after Spring Break
Python Toolbox that includes several tools that have been coded and documented by yourself and released as a Github repository | 25% | Session after Spring Break | End of term
Github account portfolio | 20% | Session before Spring Break | End of term

**1. Attendance and participation:** Attendance is critical to your success in this class. To earn full credit, you must attend and participate in each and every class. If you have an emergency, you are ill, or you have an absence covered under the University policies (i.e. Holy Days, University Sanctioned Events) you are expected to contact the instructor in advance of class. For illness, this particularly pertains to flu-like symptoms, so if you do exhibit signs of flu, contact the instructor and stay home to minimize transference of the virus. Unexcused absences will result in a lower course grade.

**2. Weekly coding challenges:**  Learning to code is not something that can be done entirely within a classroom, as it requires much practice and reinforcement, which can only be achieved individually. Prior to each class you will undertake an self-study “Coding challenge”, which will take approximately two to three hours of your time. The first 10 minutes of each class is reserved for the coding challenge quiz, whereby you will answer specific questions pertaining to your code, the methods used and the produced output. Addresses learning outcomes 1 and 2.

**3. Midterm tool challenge:** In this assignment, you are instructed to produce a small tool that takes advantage of arcpy and Python. You will need to provide example data, and the code should run on all PC's. The tool needs to manipulate a dataset across three different processes, for example, extracting, modifying and exporting data. The exact workflow is entirely up to yourself. You are expected to take 3-4 hours on this coding assignment, and you should deposit your code and example files within a Github repository for feedback and grading. Criteria are, 1) cleanliness of code, 2) functionality, appropriate use of documentation and depth of processing operation. Assignment due week 9. Addresses learning outcomes 1, 2 and 3.

**4. Python Toolbox:** In your final assignment for this course, you should create a Python Toolbox that contains a minimum of three simple tools for undertaking geoprocessing and file management operations. These tools can be discrete or part of a larger workflow. However, the caveats are that you should create a "single file" toolbox (no includes, or external file tools) and not exceed 2000 lines of code in its entirety. You should document the toolbox using Github README.md and provide example data for running each of your tools. Grading and feedback will focus on: 1) Does the toolbox install, and the tools run successfully? 2) cleanliness of code, 3) functionality and depth of processing operation, and 4) appropriate use of documentation. Assignment due week 14. Addresses learning outcomes 1, 2, 3 and 4.

**5. Github account portfolio:** The final assessment component is your Github coding portfolio. As a coder, your Github account can also act as an unofficial resume, providing potential employers, graduate supervisors or collaborators with ready access to your prior work. You must maintain a high quality Github account for the other assignments set, this includes providing adequate and well-organized readme files, well commented code and a coherent file structure. Grading and feedback will focus on 1) High level of organization and 2) Descriptive readme files and well commented code. Assignment due week 14. Addresses learning outcome 4.
