# Final Toolbox Challenge (due Friday Apr 30 17.30pm)

In your final assignment for this course, you should create a Python Toolbox that contains a minimum of three simple tools for undertaking geoprocessing and file management operations. These tools can be discrete or part of a larger workflow. However, the caveats are that you should create a "single file" toolbox (no includes, or external file tools) and you should aim to not exceed 2000 lines of code in its entirety (but if you do, no worries). You should document the toolbox using Github README.md and provide example data for running each of your tools. Grading and feedback will focus on: 1) Does the toolbox install, and the tools run successfully? 2) cleanliness of code, 3) functionality and depth of processing operation, and 4) appropriate use of documentation. Plus, 5) provide example data that allows me to test your tools.

The criteria are:
* Does the toolbox install and run? (25 points)
* Cleanliness of code (25 points)
* Functionality and depth of processing (25 points)
* Appropriate use of documentation (15 points)
* In addition, you must provide example data (10 points).

Help is here when you need it, just email Andy.
