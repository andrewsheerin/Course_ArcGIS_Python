# Coding Challenge 1

Please create a Github Repository, which has a simple "README.md" file in it that describes yourself and your interests. You must use Github markdown (here is a helpful link: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and express yourself using a variety of markdown styles (headings, images, links etc).

You must submit this repository to the "Github Classroom, Coding Challenge 1" area. You will receive an invitation link to that particular area via email and we will go from there.

Note that there is no grade for this initial coding challenge. I have not used "Classroom" before, so there are likely niggles that will need to be worked out.

Please do this before our next class.
