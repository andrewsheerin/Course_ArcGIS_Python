# Coding Challenge 1

Please create a Github Repository (and if you don't already have one, a Github account), which contains a simple "README.md" file that describes yourself and your interests, sort of a profile if you will. You can used made up data if you wish, but feel free to use real data about yourself. The repository itself can be kept *Private* on Github, and will be submitted to our Github Classroom as a private repository.

You must use Github markdown (here is a helpful [link](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)), and express yourself using a variety of markdown styles (headings, images, links etc). Try to explore as much as you can. Markdown is used extensively throughout the web, not only on Github (e.g. Reddit, Stackoverflow etc).

You must submit this repository to the "Github Classroom > Coding Challenge 1" area. You will receive an invitation link to that particular area via email and we will go from there.

Note that there is no grade for this initial coding challenge. I have not used "Classroom" before, so there are likely niggles that will need to be worked out, and we may each need to correspond via email to work it out!

**Please do this before our next class.**
