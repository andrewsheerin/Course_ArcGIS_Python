# Coding Challenge 7

Our coding challenge this week should make use of temporary folders, output folders and file management.

Convert your Coding Challenge 5 exercise to work with temporary folders, os.path.join and glob.glob. Do not take too much time on this
and if you do not have a working Challenge 5, talk to the instructor.
